Before you apply for a passport here are the documents you will need 

The authorities will only issue you a valid passport if you have documents proving the following:

    Your date of birth, which can be proven with a birth certificate.
    An identity certificate along with a photograph. This will be verified by Passport Seva.
    Your address proof
    Proof of your Indian citizenship. This will also be verified by Passport Seva Kendra.
